# Learn Go with tests

Current Go version: `go1.23.0 darwin/arm64`

To run `godoc`:
```bash
godoc -http=localhost:6060
```

To run tests:
```bash
go test
```
Make sure to either stay in the directory to run the test code, or specify which directory to run the test from the root directory (i.e. `go test ./integers`).
